<h1>WHAT IS LOREM IPSUM?</h1>

<p><b> Lorem ipsum</b> is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.Lorem Ipsum has been the industrys standard dummy
text ever since the 1500s, when an unkown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. it has
survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electeonic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in
the 1960s with the release of leteset sheets containing Loren Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like <b><u>
Aldus pagemaker</u></b> including versions of <u><strong> Lorem Ipsum</strong></u>.<strong> 1914 transition by H.Rackman</strong> </p>



  <blockquote>    But i must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure pain was born and i wiill give you a complete
             account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great explorer of the truth, the master-builder of human happiness.
             No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because thise who do not know how to 
             pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremly painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves 
             or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and
             pain can procure him some great pleasure.</blockquote>


<h1> WHY DO WE USE IT?</h1>

<P> it is a long established fact that a reader will be disteactes by the readable content of a page wheen looking at its layout.The point of using<u> Lorem Ipsum</u> is that
    it has a more-or-less nornal disteibution of letters,as opposed to using <q> content here</q>, making it look like readable english. many desktop publishing packages and 
    web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for <q> lorem Ipsum</q> will uncover many 
    web sites still in thir infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose
    (injected humour and the like). </p>



<h1>WHERE CAN I GET SOME?</h1>

<p><b> There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available,but the majority have suffered alteration in some form,
       by injected humour, or <u> randomized words</u> which dont look even slightly believable.</b> If you are going to use
       a passage of lorem ipsum, you need to be sure there isnt anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum generators
       on the internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator onthe internet. it
       uses a dictionary of over 200 latin words, combined with a handful of model sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum
       which looks reasonable. The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition, injected humour, or non-
       characteristic words etc. </p>
